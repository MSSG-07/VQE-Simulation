his interactive Streamlit application simulates the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the ground-state energy of the H₂ molecule. Built with Qiskit, it features real-time visualizations, adjustable bond lengths, and detailed circuit insights. Dive in, explore quantum chemistry hands-on, and discover how hybrid quantum-classical algorithms behave in practice.
